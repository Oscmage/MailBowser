## Objectives
The issues that we now have resolved before this meeting is that we have now decided what project we will do, which is a multiplayer version of the boardegame battleship.

## Reports
Since this is our first propper meeting, there have been no issuses frm the last meeting, but we have already made a few scetches what the application will look like.

## Discussion items

#### What design patterns will we use?
After a short discussion we have all decided that Model-View-Control will suit this application the best.

#### What frameworks will we use?
We decided that everyone should get familiar with jMonkeyEngine and that we would use that. The project will be a Maven project and that we might use mbassador to help us with the observer classes.

## Outcomes and assignments
Mikael have finished the first part of the RAD, so Fredrik will take a long on the second part.

Daniel will start looking over the SDD and what has to be done with that document.

Everyone should get Maven to their own IDEs.

Mikael should take the scetches and evaluete them with someone outside the project.
